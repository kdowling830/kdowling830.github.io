<ul> Running was a very important sport for me in high school. The cross country team and track team were places where I met some of my best friends. It was always a sport that made me feel confident in myself. I wish that I had continued with my running in college, but it was truly just a fun hobby to be with my friends and stay in shape. </ul>

<ul> This is one of my best friends, Renee. She got me through a lot of really hard practices when we had long runs and difficult workouts. I'm so glad that she was apart of my running experiences! </ul>

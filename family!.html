<ul> This is a photo of my mother, Marilisa (left), my sister, Abbey (right), and myself (middle). We are sitting on our family dock at our camp on Sebec lake in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. Abbey is 22 and just graduated from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. Abbey is the most creative and innovative person I have ever encountered. She also is a very caring person for the people she loves.  My mother has been and first and second grade looping teacher for 28 years in Scarborough, Maine. My mother is the most selfless person I have ever met in my life and she amazes me everyday because of that. </ul>

<ul> This is my oldest sister, Anna and I before my senior prom. She graduated from University of Maine Farmington in 2017 and now works as a teacher in Standish, Maine. I love that Anna can always make me feel better when I am down! Anna, like Abbey, is one of my best friends in this world. </ul>

<ul> This is my dad, Jay and I at a wedding. He works as a salesman at Village Candle in Maine. My favorite things about my dad include, his humor, his competitiveness, and his kindness. </ul>

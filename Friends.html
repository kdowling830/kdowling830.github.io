<ul> A group of my friends and I went on a hike in Franconia falls this summer. I hiked with my friends Noelle, Eric, Zach, Maria, Renee, and Dawson. It was about a four mile hike and we were able to swim in the pond at the top of the trail! I met all of them during outdoor track and we became very close. This turned us into a frequent hiking group!</ul>

<ul>This is my best friend Catie! I have known her since I was 3. She lives in my neighborhood and we became close as soon as we met! She is a year older and studies Linguistics at The University of Southern Maine. This is the longest we have gone without seeing each other since we have met. Can't to see her again! </ul>

<ul>These are some of the first friends that I have made at The University of Maine. Kat is the one taking the photo, Tyler is in the middle, Meg is on the far right, and myself on the far left. Can't wait to make more friends like these ones at The University of Maine!</ul>
